Cybersecurity Internship – Nmap Network Scan Report

Tool used: Nmap (-sS TCP SYN scan)

Network scanned: 192.168.1.0/24

Date: 04 August 2025

Purpose: Identify active devices and open ports on the local network for risk assessment.


Risks Identified
Open HTTP port on router	Unencrypted access — may expose login credentials if admin page is not secured
SSH on desktop			If weak passwords are used, could be brute-forced
ADB on Android device		Port 5555 allows remote access — should be disabled when not in use
RDP on laptop			Exposes remote desktop login — should be behind VPN or disabled if unused


Conclusion & Recommendations
Several devices expose open ports commonly targeted by attackers.

Unsecured services (like HTTP or ADB) should be disabled or secured with firewalls.

It is recommended to:

Disable ADB when not in use

Change default credentials on all devices

Enable HTTPS on router

Restrict RDP access to internal/VPN-only use
